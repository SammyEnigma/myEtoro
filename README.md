# Install
Copy the code into a new GreaseMonkey userscript
Create a Google sheet with the titles of the following columns:
- NAME: names of the markets such as display in Etoro (COPPER, BTC, AAPL, STM. MI,...)
- ER: dates of earning reports
- ALERT: if you put a cross, the name of the market will be highlighted in Etoro
- LEVERAGE: for a strong lever indicator 
- OUT: if you want to indicate the price you've paid (to get back to a better price for example; -))
- TARGET: your price target
- ESTIMATE: price consensus
- NOTE: what you want... I write down my analysis (resistance for example) and the action to be taken (guidance for example)
- TYPE: US/EU/MAT/CR, allows to filter the markets (to see only open markets for example)
Columns are (normally) not mandatory, use the ones you want. If a market is not present or poorly rated, the script will simply not do anything about it.
Start rating the markets you are interested in.
Share your sheet and note the sharing link.

In the code:
- note this link in the variable idSpreadsheet
- note the name of your sheet in SheetName

Activez le script sur Etoro :).
